of LAU/NUTS concordance tables\nSee source for details\nNotice that the concordance tables present many inconsistencies and do not fully match the LAU dataset distributed for the correspondent dataset. See this page for some attempts at using the correspondence tables, and this other page for an alternative solution that offers consistent matching based on available data. Consider that full correspondence between LAU and NUTS may be tricky, as changing of LAU boundaries along NUTS boundary may cause some former municipalities to be moved from a NUTS to the other.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nN.B. This is a work in progress. Ensure that the data provided are fit for purpose.\nThis repository presents datasets of the population-weighted centres of local administrative units in Europe, the scripts used to generate them with different approaches, as well as details on quality checks and peculiarities of the data.\nIt also tries to facilitate matching a given local administrative unit to their correspondent NUTS region.\nMotivation\nwhen showing data points of a local adminsitrative unit (or other territorial boundaries) we often need a specific point on a map to show relevant information. Where should that point fall?\nwhen taking values from a data grid it is often useful to have a specific set of coordinates: which should that be for local administrative units?\nthe LAU/NUTS concordance table distributed by Gisco have inconsistencies, making it a pain to adequately combine data (somewhat puzzingly, each year something else is missing or does not quite match)\nIn reference to population-weighted centres, check out the following blog post for context:\nHow to find the population-weighted centre of local administrative units\nPreliminary notes on terminology and data\nLAU stands for “local administrative unit” and usually coincides with municipalities\nNUTS stands for “nomenclature of territorial units for statistics”; there are NUTS of different levels, including NUTS 3 (mostly province/district/county or equivalent), NUTS 2 (larger regions), NUTS 1 (macro-regions).\nSee the relevant Wikipedia page for details.\nEurostat releases every year an updated datasets with LAUs, including basic statistics about each of them as well as the spatial boundaries in formats that can be read by a number of software packages. The same is true for NUTS, with the exception that they are not updated yearly: recent years of release of NUTS regions include 2021, 2016, and 2013.\nBesides, the coverage of these datasets is not the same across all years, as some countries were not part of the NUTS system earlier on.\nThis discrepancy in release dates means that, as LAUs are merged or change their boundaries, sometimes across different NUTS regions, there may not be perfect concordance between, for example, LAU for 2019 and NUTS for 2016. Eurostat does distribute concordance table, but these are not perfectly consistent (some LAUs are missing for some countries, some countries are missing, etc.).\nThis forces users of these data to make a judgement call: should they use old data? should they manually find where the LAUs missing in the concordance tables are located? Should they mix and match?\nThis repository outlines some possible solutions and provides consistently pre-processed data. The user should still be mindful of the structural imperfection of the results.\nSteps and intermediate datasets\nSince fully consistent concordance tables between LAU and NUTS published by the EU are not available for most years, a first step in the data processing involves situating each LAU in a NUTS region. This is achieved by calculating the overlap between the relevant geometries.\nThis process results in three sets of datasets:\none with the overlap of each LAU in a given year, with the NUTS of a given year (this can be useful, for example, for quality checks or for caching data when processing in bulk)\none with full concordance between LAU and NUTS, where each LAU it is attributed to the LAU where it has most of its surface (N.B. the resulting dataset may not be fully consistent with official statistics as the possibility that a tiny number of LAUs may be misattributed to a neighbouring NUTS cannot be excluded)\na third and probably most useful dataset based on official concordance table, falling back to the above solution when concordance tables are incomplete, is finally distributed\nIt is finally possible to get back\nData availability\nThis repository covers local administrative units as distributed by Europen Union’s Gisco services, and tentatively in nieghbouring jurisdictions.\nThe main determinants of data availability are:\ninclusion of relevant country in the LAU datasets for the relevant year\ncoverage by the EU population grid as distributed by the EU’s Gisco services\nAdditional sources for the population grid include High Resolution Population Density Maps distributed by Facebook.\nGADM for administrative boundaries.\nSources\nLocal Administrative Units (LAU)\nThe original dataset of Local Administrative Units (LAU) can be downloaded from the following link: https://gisco-services.ec.europa.eu/distribution/v2/lau/download/\nLAU can be matched to NUTS via concordance tables: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/local-administrative-units\nPopulation grid\nThe population grid can be downloaded from the following link: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/population-distribution-demography/geostat\nDetails on how the population grid was generated as well as context on the reliability of the data is included in the factsheet that can be downloaded with the latest available dataset (at the time of writing), based on 2018 data and released in 2021:\nLicensing\n© EuroGeographics for the administrative boundaries (see full licensing details for LAUs)\nLicensing for the population grid dataset varies depening on year and the country originally providing the data.

      "contents": "\nCombining LAU and NUTS using publicly available datasets is not as straightforward as it may seem, due to small inconsistencies in the data, the cumbersome and internally inconsistent format chosen by GISCO to distribute the concordance tables, and first of all, the puzzling choice not to include reference to NUTS in the datasets with local administrative units to begin with.\nThere does not seem to be any combination of concordance tables that fully match with the LAU dataset for the relevant year. Mixing and matching between different years may for different countries may eventually bring us closer to the desired outcome, but may lead to some inconsistencies of its own.\nFind below more details about proposed viable tables that offer full matching with the LAU of the relevant year, i.e. 100% of the LAUs are paired to a NUTS region.\nLAU 2020 / NUTS 2021\nUntil Gisco finally distributes a consistent dataset (hopefully LAU 2021/NUTS2021), rather than mixing and matching, we decided to calculate belonging to a NUTS region based on the most recently distributed geographic dataset: LAU 2020/NUTS 2021. This may still potentially lead to some inconsistencies for LAUs with recently changed borders along the adminsitrative boundary of some NUTS region, but, all things considered, this is expected to offer an accurate dataset, possibly bar a handful of cases.\n\n\n\nThe area covered by both datasets (LAU 2020 / NUTS 2021) includes 35 countries: AL, AT, BE, BG, CH, CY, CZ, DE, DK, EE, EL, ES, FI, FR, HR, HU, IE, IS, IT, LI, LT, LU, LV, MK, MT, NL, NO, PL, PT, RO, RS, SE, SI, SK, UK.\n\n\n\nHow reliable is the matching?\n\n\n\nGiven some inconsistencies and different resolution we expect LAUs located along a NUTS boundary line to not match exactly with NUTS. We expect a difference up to 10, perhaps 20 percent, to be likely attributable to mismatches in the geo dataset, no actual changes on the ground.\nAs a consequence, there are probably just a handful of cases where the matching is not perfectly accurate.\nHere is a full list of LAUs which, according to available datasets, do not have more than 90% of their area within a given NUTS:\n\ngisco_id\nnuts_3\narea\narea_share\nDE_07333056\nDEB3D\n1706254.5\n0.8986020\nRO_154308\nRO317\n61297860.9\n0.8974089\nNL_GM0394\nNL329\n184536245.3\n0.8943929\nCH_CH9327\nCH052\n167441.0\n0.8940607\nEL_45080201\nEL303\n687968.5\n0.8655517\nEL_02050206\nEL514\n3765168.8\n0.8515297\nFR_39140\nFRC22\n759160.4\n0.8509431\nDE_01053075\nDEF06\n2673362.4\n0.8364477\nRO_153062\nRO317\n75527939.8\n0.8363154\nDE_16072013\nDEG0H\n80315831.6\n0.7433631\nNL_GM1952\nNL113\n213183034.7\n0.7230271\nNL_GM1961\nNL33A\n110046868.2\n0.7204488\nDE_16054000\nDEG04\n101274434.3\n0.7112290\nFR_44180\nFRG01\n125043370.5\n0.6576246\nFR_50592\nFRD12\n21616442.2\n0.6192706\nAT_61061\nAT225\n29079891.7\n0.6074245\nDE_16066095\nDEG0B\n53852351.4\n0.5690889\n\nHow consistent is the matching?\nDo all LAUs have their own NUTS?
